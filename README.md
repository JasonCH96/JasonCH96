# Hi, I'm Jason! 👋
### Systems Engineering Student | Junior QA Engineer | Full-Stack Developer

- 📍 Based in Costa Rica
- 🎓 Currently studying Systems Engineering
- 💼 Hospitality Operations Manager with a passion for Software Quality and Development.

## 🚀 About Me
I’m a Systems Engineering student with a background in Operations Management and Banking. Why does that matter? Because it allows me to see the "big picture" behind the code.

I specialize in the intersection of Development and Quality Assurance. My goal is to bridge the gap between complex technical requirements and smooth user experiences. I’m currently looking for opportunities where I can apply my logic, my attention to detail, and my experience leading processes to help build high-quality software solutions.
